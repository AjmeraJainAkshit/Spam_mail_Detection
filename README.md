# Project Insights: Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning
âœ… **Objective**: Build a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing and Logistic Regression.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

ðŸ§  **Model Used**: Logistic Regression proved to be highly effective in binary text classification.

ðŸ“‚ **Tools & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorizer, Logistic Regression

âœ¨ **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF helped highlight significant keywords, improving model performance.

ðŸ§¹ **Minimal Preprocessing**: Only basic data cleaning (null handling and label encoding) was needed.

ðŸ“ˆ **Performance**: Achieved strong accuracy on both training and test sets, indicating good generalization.

ðŸ”® **Real-World Use Case**: A functional prediction system allows for live classification of new email messages as spam or ham.
